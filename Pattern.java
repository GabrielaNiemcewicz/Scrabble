/*absolut value algorithm is derived as set of transformations of f(x) = |x| function:
|x-7|, to return only positive indices within scope of scrabble board, size = 15. If size=?, then|x-middle()|
 7-|x-7|, to start drawing V from 0, that is from edge of board.  
 middle()-|x-middle()| 
Exclude i=0, i=SIZE-1 from the 'for-loop'to not include Squares that are on edge of board
Exclude Square with absolut=0 from drawing X pattern by two V patterns- left and right. Reason: value assigned two times. Different value to rule of V assignment. If removed from rules, V and X assignment rules are identical. Middle X assignment belongs to draw_Scttered_3W. 
middle(size)-|x+VECTOR-middle(size)| For small V: add displacement vector, so that's middle(size) is at middle(). So that small V is in the middle, and not drawn from index 0.
VECTOR OF DISPLACEMENT: start drawing at egde of board at (SIZE-size)/2. 
	for small v= (15-7)/2 = 3 mod.1 = 3 (drop modulo).
	for big V = (15-15)/0 = 0 ( X goes across the corners, thus 0)
Divide by 2 because of symmetry of Squares outside of V. If V.size is 7, 15-7=8 squares outside of V. 4 squares each side. Counted from index 0.  So using V-start vector ends up with result 3.
END OF VECTOR OF DISPLACEMENT= beginning+length = (SIZE-size)/2 + size = SIZE/2 +size/2 = (size+SIZE)/2
^in practice, FROM (size-SIZE)/2-1 TO (size+SIZE)/2-1, because ends of V were trimmed, so that they don't touch edge of board
